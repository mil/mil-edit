Firstly, I want to apologize for any style problems.  This was my first JS project in a long time. As a result I didn't *exactly* know what I was doing. Though I think it came out fine and the code is semi-readable. Feel free to do a re-write or change up my code if you want.

Anyway, with apologies aside: 

mil edit at all times assumes your DOM tree starting from your root selector (#editor by default) looking like:
- div#editor
    * ul
        * li
            - Some top Level content
        * li
            - ul
                * li
                    - Second level content
        * li
            - More top level content

The critical idea is that sub-lists are not children of the previous item. ul's stand alone. Indentation is a function of an extra wrapper ul li nest.

Zepto is used extensively for maintaining this structure with each operation.

More Questions? Ping me on IRC, mil on irc.freenode.net
